This is a set of test harnesses that produce TAP messages (http://testanything.org) for ooze, analysis, and jigs.
Here's a brief breakdown of the files here:

	/analysis - the code necessary to interface with analysis modules
	/jig - the code necessary to interface with jig modules
	/ooze - the code necessary to interface with ooze modules
	/tap - the code that handles the TAP format
	/testfile - the code that parses our testfiles
	/tap_tests - the testfiles for the various modules (note that analysis modules don't take testfiles at the moment)


The testfile format is as follows:

[Testfile Version]

["ENVS" followed by a "environment variable"="value"]

[a test harness dependent meta line]
the tests to run
