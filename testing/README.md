## Running Tests
### How do I run the tests?
You need to run the `run.sh` script from **_this_** directory. You must have docker installed.
### This is taking a while!
That's a complaint, not a question.
### Why is this taking so long?
It has to create a docker container on the first run. It should be cached, so it only takes a while on the first run.
### What happened?
It should have run all of the tests and put them in a timestamped folder.

## Adding Tests
### How do I add a test?
Just update the `test_everything.sh` to include your tests. Make sure to forward your results to the `$results_folder`.
