# Common

A convenient repository for library functions usable across internals, plugins, tests, and user code. This project compiles to a shared library called 'gtfo_common.so'.

## Dependencies

This library depends on Intel's libipt and libxed libraries.

If these dependencies are not installed, 'gtfo_common.so' will still build, but with limited functionality.

##### Intel libipt

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/intel/libipt; cd libipt; mkdir build; cd build; CC=clang cmake ..; make; sudo make install; cd ..;

```

##### Intel libxed
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/intelxed/xed; git clone https://github.com/intelxed/mbuild.git; cd xed; ./mfile.py --shared install;
sudo cp kits/xed-install-base-2019-09-25-lin-x86-64/lib/libxed.so /usr/local/lib/;
sudo cp -r kits/xed-install-base-2019-09-25-lin-x86-64/include/xed /usr/local/include;
cd ../;
```

## Building and Installing

If you run `make install` in your build directory, this library will be installed as '/usr/local/lib/libgtfo_common.so' on Linux systems.

## APIs

This library is a collection of utility subsystems. API descriptions are grouped below by subsystem.

Software utilizing this library may include '/usr/local/gtfo/include/common.h', which includes all subsystem header files, or may include just the individual header file(s) of a subsystem of interest.

### Logging

Messages are logged to a file or stdout using a printf-like interface after prepending a severity-level character and the module #define name. 

#### init_logging
```c
void init_logging(void);
```

##### Description

This function initializes logging. By default,logging is sent to `stdout`. If an environment variable named `LOG_FILENAME` is set, output will be sent to the specified filename. Additionally, the `LOG_DEBUG_MODULE` environment variable can be defined. This environment variable is used in the `log_debug()` function.


#### output
```c
void output(char *msg, ...);
```

##### Description

This function simply outputs `msg` in a _printf_-like fashion. 

#### log_info
```c
void log_info(char *msg, ...);
```
##### Description
This function behaves similarly to the `output()` function described above.
 
Additionally, this function prepends the characters `[+]` and the `MODULE` that has initialized the logger:

```text
[+] MODULE: <printf message>
```
 
As an example, if the "the_fuzz" project contained the following line:
```c 
 log_info("It's all good in the neighborhood!");
```

Our `MODULE` is "the_fuzz" and the resultant output would look like this:

```text
[+] the_fuzz: It's all good in the neighborhood!
```

#### log_warn
```c
void log_warn(char *msg, ...);
```

##### Description
Similar to `output()` and `log_info()` above, but `[!]` is now prepended:

```text
[!] MODULE: <printf message>
```

#### log_fatal
```
_Noreturn void log_fatal(char *msg, ...);
```
##### Description

Similar to `log_info()`, but `[X]` is now prepended and the program is terminated:  

```text
[X] MODULE: <printf message>
```

#### log_debug
```c
void log_debug(char *msg, ...);
```
##### Description
Similar to `log_info()` above, but `[?]` is now prepended.

```text
[?] MODULE: <printf message>
```

This function will only produce output if the `LOG_DEBUG_MODULE` environment variable was set during `init_logging()`.

The `MODULE` string must be a substring of `LOG_DEBUG_MODULE`.

#### log\_report\_seed
```c
void log_report_seed(char *seed);
```
##### Description
Similar to _log\_info_ above, but`[S]` is prepended:

```text
[S] MODULE: <printf message>
```

#### log\_report\_crash
```c
void log_report_crash(char *crash);
```

##### Description
Similar to _log\_info_ above, but `[C]` is prepended:   
```text
[C] MODULE: <printf message>
```
 
### CPUID Functions

These are simple support functions to identify the cpu type and version as required by Intel processor trace decode functions.
Mention is made here only to note their availability. As their implementation is relatively straightforward, see the code for further details:

cpu.h: 

```c
int pt_cpu_read(struct pt_cpu *cpu);
```  

cpuid.h:
```c
void pt_cpuid(uint32_t leaf, uint32_t *eax, uint32_t *ebx, uint32_t *ecx, uint32_t *edx);
```


### Intel Processor Trace Decoders 

#### pt_packet_decode
```c
void pt_packet_decode(unsigned char *trace_buffer, size_t trace_size)
```

##### Description
Given a buffer of trace data produced by Intel's Processor Trace hardware feature, this function will decode and print the stream of trace packet types and their byte offset within the buffer. Further information on packet types can be found in 'Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 3, Chapter 35' 

Example decoded trace data generated by a custom tap test:

```text
...

Extract call returned true 0x266b630 70976.

```

__Note:__ `pt_packet_decode()` is contained in 'fastdecode.c', which was sourced from 'github.com/andikleen/simple-pt' in July 2019 and still contains Intel headers.
It was slightly modified to be present this call interface instead of a `main()` function to produce a command.
It should therefore be relatively easy to update with a new source pull from github.


#### Instruction Stream Decode
```c
int pt_inst_decode(uint8_t *trace_buffer, size_t trace_size, read_memory_callback_t *read_image_callback, void *context);

typedef int (read_memory_callback_t)(uint8_t *buffer, size_t size, const struct pt_asid *asid, uint64_t ip, void *context);
```

##### Description

Decodes and prints an instruction stream based on the supplied Intel hardware processor trace data buffer together with original binary program data. The trace data to be decoded is contained in `trace_buffer`. `pt_packet_decode()` will call the user supplied `read_image_callback()` function with the supplied `context` to obtain `size` bytes of the program traced at address `ip` as loaded in its original load/mapping location.

Example decoded trace data generated by a custom tap test:

```text
...

Intel processor trace INSTRUCTION decode results:
