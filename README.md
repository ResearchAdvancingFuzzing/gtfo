# The Generalizable Testbed for Fuzzing Operations

The Generalizable Testbed for Fuzzing Operations (GTFO) is a collection of modular components that are designed to be used together to conduct fuzz testing.

## Core Components

1. 'common/' - A Library containing common C Definitions, objects, and code used by other components, including logging  and Intel processor trace data decoding.
2. 'nocturne/' - A Framework that manages usage of the KVM hypervisor and provides additional functionality.
3. 'ooze/' - A collection of modular input generation strategies for use in fuzz testing.
4. 'the_fuzz/' - Our core fuzzer. It conducts fuzz testing, provides a UI, and performs crash detection and reporting.

## Building & Installing

Building requires clang-3.9+ and cmake 3.5+ on Linux.
 
Supported Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS

Nocturne is only supported on Linux kernel 4.15.0-13-generic

Building on MacOS, Linux with gcc, or on Windows by using Cygwin are no longer supported.

### Dependencies

#### Apt Dependencies
```shell script
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev clang cmake build-essential pkg-config libyaml-0-2 libyaml-dev python-yaml
```

Additionally, the following two dependencies should be installed for gtfo's common library.

If these dependencies are not installed, gtfo's common library will still build, but with limited functionality.

#### Intel libipt
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/intel/libipt; cd libipt; mkdir build; cd build; CC=clang cmake ..; make; sudo make install; cd ..;

```

#### Intel libxed
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/intelxed/xed; git clone https://github.com/intelxed/mbuild.git; cd xed; ./mfile.py --shared install;
sudo cp kits/xed-install-base-2019-09-25-lin-x86-64/lib/libxed.so /usr/local/lib/;
sudo cp -r kits/xed-install-base-2019-09-25-lin-x86-64/include/xed /usr/local/include;
cd ../;
```

#### Pip Dependencies
```shell script
pip install ply scipy numpy

```

#### Nocturne Kernel Patch

In order to properly utilize Nocturne on the test execution system, our kernel patches must be applied.

The Intel Processor Trace (IPT) hardware feature, and it's related kernel patches are not required in order to use Nocturne.

If you would like to use Nocturne, but your CPU does not support IPT, you should apply the kernel patch located in 'nocturne/patchfiles/Ubuntu-4.15.0-13.14\_kvm\_fuzzing.patch'.

If you would like to use IPT, you should apply the kernel patch located in in 'nocturne/patchfiles/Ubuntu-4.15.0-13.14-Intel\_PT\+MMIO\_RESET.patch'.
 
The kernel source must then be built, and installed. You must then reboot the system.

__NOTE:__ Apt might be configured to perform unattended upgrades. If so, it may replace our patched kvm header files and break the build.

If this happens to you, our fix was to edit the contents of '/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades' and disable unattended upgrades:

```text
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "0";
```

#### General Build

The entire gtfo source tree is built via:

```shell script
cd gtfo
./build.sh
```

To build a debug version of everything:

```shell script
cd gtfo
./build.sh -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

#### Installation

General build output files are located in 'gtfo/build'. They may be installed by the following bash command:

```shell script
gtfo/build; make install;
```
The default install locations for files destined for directories such as bin, include, lib, etc. is '/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/local/lib', etc.

Use of '/usr/local' can be overridden by setting DESTDIR like so:
 
```shell script
make DESTDIR=/home/john install;
```

This is preferable to changing the value of `$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.


##### Specific Subsystem Builds

Like any good build system, gtfo is structured to facilitate building individual subsystems. This is particularly useful when focusing on developing changes to a subsystem where it would be counterproductive to rebuild the entire build tree with each source code edit.

Any subsystem directory that contains a _CMakeLists.txt_ file is individually buildable. Build steps are the creation of a _build_ directory and processing the cmake file if this is the first time, then running the _make_ command. For example, if we were enhancing the _breakpoint\_single\_step_ plugin, the first debug build of this subsystem would be:

```shell script
	cd gtfo/nocturne/pluginssrc/breakpoint_single_step
	mkdir build
	CC=clang cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
	make
```

The output of the build will be contained in the local build directory, not gtfo/build/...


>__IMPORTANT:__ If _CMakeLists.txt_ is changed, you __must__ ```cd build; rm -rf *``` prior to performing a ```cmake ..``` else cmake will incorrectly re-use some cached files causing unpredictable results.
